# Sudoku Solver
Project for my Artificial Intelligence class at UFMG in 2018 in which we had to solve a Constraint Satisfactory Problem (CSP).

This work implements different [algorithms](https://github.com/felipecacique/SudokuSolver/blob/main/sudoku_solver.py) to solve a Sudoku of sizes 9x9, 16x16, and 25x25, including backtracking, arc consistency algorithm (AC3), and some heuristics. 
The [notebook](https://github.com/felipecacique/SudokuSolver/blob/main/sudoku_solver.ipynb) demonstrates an example of how to use the developed functions to solve a Sudoku so that you can solve yours! :)

The method "AC_3 + Heuristics + Backtracking" was found to be the fastest and the most complete one. 

For more details on the project, algorithms, pseudocode, and time complexity, check the [paper](https://github.com/felipecacique/SudokuSolver/blob/main/Sudoku%20Solver%20-%20Felipe%20Vital.pdf).
